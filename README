HOW TO COMPILE
Please use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FennelFoxxo/retype_issue.git` to install properly - otherwise submodules will not be downloaded
Once downloaded, run `make` in the root project folder. The final image will written to build/disk.img

HOW TO USE
Use `make run` to run as a UEFI image on QEMU
Use `make simulate` to run the default ./simulate folder in the seL4 build folder

Note: yes, I've included two precompiled files in here, BOOTX64.EFI (GRUB bootloader) and OVMF_CODE.fd - the only reason why is because I can't include the GRUB git add a submodule because gnu.org is currently down (lol) and the EDK2 project to compile OVMF_CODE.fd is huge
I did just download and compile the bootloader EFI a week ago however. The OVMF_CODE.fd was obtained from the most recent build from the kraxel repo referenced by this page https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/OVMF
